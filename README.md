This is a minimal version of stereoset code found https://stereoset.mit.edu/. </br>

I took bert-base and wrote a code to predict scores for dev set and then evaluate it with the authors code. This is a learning project. 

- If you are interested in some analysis of StereoSet, check "Detecting Bias in Language Model .ipynb"
- Should you want to replicate, look into "Predicting for stereoset.ipynb"
